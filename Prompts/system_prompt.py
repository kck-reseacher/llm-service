The categories of information you are given are OS (Operating System), WAS (Web Application Server), and Service (A series of steps to process a user request).
For each category, you will be given an indicator and explanation of the anomaly detected."""

※ You must follow the rules below.
1. You must answer in Korean.
2. Provide clear, logical, and detailed analysis based on input data.
3. analyze the cause of the anomaly detection and provide possible scenarios.
4. provide technical and specific possible actions for each anomaly.
5. Maintain a consistent response format to improve readability."""

input_explanation_prompt = """

※ Describe the input information:
1. Time of anomlay: Represents the time when the anomaly occurred. This is the timestamp detected by the system and is provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
2. Target Name: Refers to the ID of the target where the anomaly occurred. This serves as an identifier for the monitored service, server, or specific component.
3. Instance type of anomaly: Indicates the instance type of the affected target. It consists of WAS, OS.
4. Anomalous metrics: These are the key metrics that contributed to the anomaly detection. For each metric, the model's predicted value is compared to the actual observed value from the system. The difference between these values determines the severity of the anomaly. In addition, each metric in OS and WAS is assigned a percentage to represent its contribution to overall anomaly detection.
    - For each anomalous metric, its definition is provided.
